# MNIST-Fashion-MNIST-for-Image-Classification


##Introduction




###Objective(s)
To process images (X) of size [28 x 28] pixels and classify them into one of the 10 output categorites (Y). For the MNIST dataset, the input images are handwritten digits in the range 0 to 9 [10]. The training and test data sets contain 60,000 and 10,000 labelled images, respectively. Inspired by the handwritten digit recognition problem, another dataset called the Fashion MNIST dataset was launched where the goal is to classify images (of size [28 x 28]) into clothing categorites demonstrated in _Fig. 01_.
