# Fashion-MNIST-for-Image-Classification


##Introduction




### Objective(s)
To process images (X) of size [28 x 28] pixels and classify them into one of the 10 output categorites (Y). For the [MNIST dataset]([url](https://github.com/sssingh/hand-written-digit-classification)), the input images are handwritten digits in the range 0 to 9. The training and test data sets contain 60,000 and 10,000 labelled images, respectively. 

Just like MNIST digit classifica

Inspired by the handwritten digit recognition problem, another dataset called the [Fashion MNIST dataset]([url](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist)) was launched where the goal is to classify images (of size [28 x 28]) into clothing categorites demonstrated in _Fig. 01_.
